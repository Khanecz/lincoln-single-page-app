review: `“Lincoln was my teacher for more than one year. She helped me progress from intermediate English to advanced English. When I spoke to her, it felt like I was listening to a reporter for CNN – so her accent is very understandable, which is helpful. We worked on grammar, vocabulary, and most importantly – she helped me be more confident when I speak.” `,

    review: `“When I met Lincoln, I just moved to America and I didn't know any English. She was very a patient and helpful teacher. She can speak Spanish, so that helped a lot. She taught me enough English so I could get a job and talk to people. I can now live in America and feel comfortable and happy.” `,
